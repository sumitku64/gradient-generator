# gradient-generator
This linear gradient generator is an interactive web tool designed to help users create custom linear gradient backgrounds quickly. It combines HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality. The tool is particularly useful for web designers and developers who want to experiment with gradient effects without writing complex code manually.

Key Features

Interactive User Interface:
The application offers a user-friendly interface with color pickers, sliders, or input fields that let users select multiple colors and adjust the gradient angle. As changes are made, a live preview updates in real time.

Dynamic Code Generation:
JavaScript handles user inputs to dynamically generate the corresponding CSS code for the linear gradient. This allows users to immediately see the effect of their adjustments and easily copy the final code for use in their projects.
